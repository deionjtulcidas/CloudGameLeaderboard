## Pitt Panthers Cloud Leaderboard

This project is a cloud-hosted leaderboard where players can submit scores and view rankings through a web interface. It was built using AWS services including S3 for hosting, API Gateway for routing, Lambda for serverless backend logic, and DynamoDB for storage.

The goal was to create a serverless application that demonstrates how data can flow from a user-facing website into AWS infrastructure, update a database, and then be displayed back to the user in real time.
